# Tasks App For Learning Apollo GraphQL

## Description

A basic app for learning graphQL. No features as such are mandatory. Basic CRUD functionality is what I aim to have with perhaps user accounts and authentication.

## Questions

1. When I delete a task I'm currently getting the error below.

2. When I add a new task I had to turn off `React.StrictMode` to not get this warning.
